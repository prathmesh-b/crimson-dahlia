Repository for Team Crimson Dahlia - Spring 2026 Cohort

## Community Aid

**The idea:** A simple, accessible web app where community members can ask for help and offer help to each other. Someone needs groceries picked up? A ride to an appointment? Help paying a utility bill? This is where neighbors can connect.

The key word here is **_accessible_** — this should be easy for anyone to use, regardless of their tech savviness. Think Craigslist vibes: straightforward, no-frills, gets the job done. How do you make it easy for someone to post a request, and easy for helpers to find requests they can fulfill?


## Minimum Viable Product (**Goal by 2/4/2026**)
